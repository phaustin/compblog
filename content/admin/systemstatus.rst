:summary: How to find out if the the email/web server is down


* If you're outside the department and lose access to email/the departmental webserver/your machines in the University Data Center:

  - Visit the EOAS announce website at http://eoas-announce.ca

    - If compstaff know about the problem they will post any information they have to eoas-announce, which is hosted on github.com servers outside of Canada

    - If the page doesn't mention any service disruptions, then the odds are good that we don't know about the issue.  To report an issue, email Phil Austin at austin.philip.h@gmail.com (using a non-departmental email account) and he will alert compstaff and update the announcement
